Hikaru Renderer Stylus nib
==========================

Stylus renderer plugin with nib for Hikaru.
-------------------------------------------

# Why

<https://github.com/stylus/nib/issues/347>

nib is the last dependency which has NodeJS 14 warnings for Hikaru, and many nib features can be done in newer CSS. So I splitted it into a single plugin.

If you need nib for your theme, please install this plugin.

I may re-add nib into Hikaru if they solve the issue.

# Usage

Run this command to install it.

```
$ npm i -s hikaru-generator-sitemap
```
